# Generative AI Course Labs and Reading Materials

## Introduction
Welcome to the Generative AI Course at Northeastern University! This repository contains the labs and reading materials designed to help you grasp the concepts and applications of generative AI. Throughout this course, you'll explore foundational and advanced techniques, gain practical experience through hands-on labs, and delve into various generative models.

## Course Description
In the "Generative AI" course, you'll not only explore foundational techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), but also delve into cutting-edge advancements such as Diffusion Models, Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). You'll receive in-depth theoretical insights into these models, accompanied by practical exercises to reinforce your understanding. Through hands-on projects, you'll learn to harness the power of Diffusion Models for high-quality image synthesis, implement RLHF techniques to optimize generative processes with human input, and leverage Graph Neural Networks to generate structured outputs from graph-structured data. By mastering these advanced techniques, you'll be equipped to tackle real-world challenges across diverse domains, from computer vision and natural language processing to social network analysis and recommendation systems.
